I have worked on these projects in courses I took related to data engineering 
#Project 1 - Instacart data warehouse 
The project contains the following stages :- 
1. Loading and storeing data for gas and weather
2. Data cleaning and exploratory analysis 
3. Create Dataflows for gas and weather
4. Create SCD's for the instacart with gas and weather data infused
